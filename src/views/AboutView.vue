            Hi, I'm Kristin, the heart and eyes behind Kristin With An Eye. I'm based in Cape Town but wander often, always seeking beauty in both people and places. I'm a wife to my incredible husband Matthew and mom to two very special boys. I'm passionate about exploring the world and capturing the quiet, meaningful moments that often go unnoticed.

            I believe storytelling has the power to connect hearts, expand understanding, and spark change.

            My journey into photography and visual storytelling began with a deep curiosity and love for stories. Since I was a young girl, I've been drawn to the gold in people and the poetry in everyday life. I was always capturing moments, advocating for causes close to my heart, and eventually found myself in the world of community development.

            With a background in Print Journalism and Social Anthropology, and over a decade of experience in the NGO and EdTech sectors, storytelling has always been part of my path. Photography was a quiet passion that kept resurfacing - a gift God gently, persistently invited me to embrace. What began as a whisper became a calling I could no longer ignore.

            I'm drawn to humble beauty - the real, raw, and often overlooked parts of life. I believe every moment holds a story worth telling.

            As a family, we made the bold and beautiful decision to pursue this vision wholeheartedly. I longed for more presence with our boys, space to create, and a way to build something soulful and sustainable. This time with them has been a sacred gift - a reminder of what truly matters.
